**COMPARISON DIFFERENT CLASSIFIERS FOR SOLVING BINARY CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM ON REVIEWS USING BAG OF WORDS MODEL**
1. The dataset used is the same as the one used for review classification using CNN and word embeddings.
2. Bag of words is a simpler method of representing sentences as vectors since they lose context of words(relying on how many times words occur in 
sentences) and often results in creation of sparse arrays of huge size. An attempt is made to compare the performance of
different classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, KNN.
